Changing or customizing the extension
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you want to change the extension itself, it is highly recommended
to contact the developers and contribute your changes back to the
project. This has several advantages:

- You can still get further updates of the extension without having to
  apply your changes again.

- The extension developers can help you integrate your code better with
  the other parts of the extension.

- Other users of the extension can benefit from your contributions.
