Installing the extension
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Conflicting extensions:** This extension cannot be installed if you
have one of the following extensions installed:

- sourceopt

**Required extensions:** This extension requires the following TYPO3
extensions to be installed beforehand:

- **static\_info\_tables**

- **oelib**

- **mkforms**

- **felogin** : If you want FE users to be able to log in so that they
  can register for events, you should also install a login extension
  like *felogin* .

- sr\_feuser\_register (optional): If you want FE users to create their
  accounts themselves, a self-registration extension like
  *sr\_feuser\_register* is recommended.

- onetimeaccount (optional): If you want users to be able to register
  for events without having to use a FE login, please use the
  *onetimeaccount* extension.

Then you can install this extension.

If you're using all three extensions  *seminars* , *onetimeaccount*
and *cal\_ts\_service* , the extension **seminarscalredirect** might
be useful for you.

In the Extension Manager, there will be some options.  **Make sure to
save these options at least once (even if you don’t change them).**
The default values are good for starters.

- You can disable the automatic configuration check when this extension
  is installed and you have finished the  *complete* configuration for
  the BE and the FE. Disabling the automatic configuration check will
  improve performance a bit. When you upgrade to a newer version of the
  extension, you should enable it again and check whether there are any
  warnings on the FE pages with the plug-in on it.

- Enable “Use the page browser” only if you have upgraded from an older
  version and you have distributed your organizer, speaker, location
  etc. records to more than one folder and you cannot move them. It is
  no problem to have registrations or events in different folders,
  though.

- Disable “Select topic records from all pages” only in one of the
  following two cases:

  - if you have really a lot (like about 20 or more) event *topic* records

  - if you already have created lots of complete event records and you now
    are just starting to use the topic/date separation for events

- You can enable “Manual sorting of events” if you want to apply manual
  sorting (with the little up/down arrows) to events in the back end. By
  default, events are sorted by begin date. Note: This setting only
  applies to the back end and has no effect on the front end whatsoever.

- You can choose the “Format of e-mails for attendees” to send text
  e-mail, HTML e-mail or HTML e-mail if the user enabled it. So that
  HTML e-mail will be send to the attendee of an event.

In your TS setup, please set config.language and config.locale\_all so
the extension will use the correct language in the front end.
