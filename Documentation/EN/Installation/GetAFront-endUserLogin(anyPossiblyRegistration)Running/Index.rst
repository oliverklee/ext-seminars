Get a front-end user login (any possibly registration) running
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Choose a login box extension and a front-end user registration
extension, install and configure them. On my site, I use  *felogin*
and  *sr\_feuser\_register* , but you may want to use others. You can
leave out the front-end user registration extension if you don't want
front-end users to be able to create their own accounts.

If you use the extension  *sr\_feuser\_register* , make sure that the
salutation modes of that extension and the  *seminars* extension are
the same so that your users get a consistent experience.

**Make sure that you make the following fields required, or this
extension won't work properly: name, email, username**

If a user is on the detail view page of an event and wants to
register, he's shown a link to the login page. The URL provided there
contains the information to redirect the user directly to the
registration page after login. Important: This feature works only with
*felogin* !

It is possible to show the events title and date on the login page, by
setting up the event headline view on the login page.To do so, insert
a page content element on the login page containing the seminars plug-
inand set the view to „event headline.“If a user clicks on the
register link of an event, the title and date of the event will be
shown on the login page.
