Do-it-yourself
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you want to provide a patch for just a single bug or feature, the
simplest way is to e-mail a tested patch to Oliver (see below).

If you want to help with more than one bug or feature, you're very
welcome to join the extension development team. Please create yourself
an account for the bug tracker.

Before you begin to create some piece of code for this extension,
please

- Read the development workflow as described above

- Get yourself the current files from the SVN repository (always work on
  the latest version of the files!). If you are working on more than one
  item, it is highly recommended to have a separate SVN tree for each
  task so that applying and creating patches is easy.

- Maybe it wouldn't be wrong to contact Oliver before working - just for
  cross-checking.

Then do your work and check the following points:

- Make sure your code works on your local installation (test it!).

- Create a patch and either attach it to a bug report or send it to a
  member of the development team for this extension to give it a peer
  review.

- As soon as the review process is finished, we'll take care of
  integrating your code to the SVN.
