========================
Installing the extension
========================

It is highly recommended to have your TYPO3 installation in composer mode.
Without Composer mode, some functionality of the extension will not be
available (e.g., inlining CSS in emails, and the CSV export (starting with
seminars 5.2.0)).

If you want visitors to be able to register for your events without a FE login,
using the onetimeaccount extension is recommended for this purpose.
