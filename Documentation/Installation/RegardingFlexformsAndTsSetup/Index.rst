Regarding flexforms and TS setup
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

After having installed this extension (and the required extensions)
via the extension manager, a few more steps are necessary to get the
extension up and running:

IMPORTANT:  **All non-empty changes at the flexforms of the plug-in
overwrite the settings of the corresponding TS setup. Empty data in
the flexforms don't overwrite non-empty data from the TS setup, so if
you want to overwrite non-empty values with empty values, you can
enter a space or a comma (depending on the field).**
