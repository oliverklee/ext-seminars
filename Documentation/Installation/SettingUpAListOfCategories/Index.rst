Setting up a list of categories
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The category list shows all categories for which there are events in
the selected system folders and in the selected time-frame. If your
events are not assigned to any categories, the category list will be
empty.

The category names are linked to the list view, filtered by that
category (in other words: only events from the selected category are
displayed).

This tutorial assumes that you already have set up a list view of your
events.

#. Add a front-end page.

#. Add a “Seminar Manager”-plug-in content element to this page and set
   the type to “Category List.”

#. Select the page that contains the list view (this page will be used
   for creating the links).

#. Optional: Select the system folders (and recursion depth) that contain
   the events for which you would like to list the categories. If you
   select nothing, events from all system folders will be taken into
   account.

#. Optional: Select the time-frame from which you the events should be
   selected. If you select nothing, current and upcoming event will be
   taken into account.

#. Save and close.
