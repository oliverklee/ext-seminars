^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We have an (English-speaking) newsgroup/mailing list on
lists.typo3.org (where all the TYPO3 newsgroups and mailing lists are
hosted). All announcements like new versions or security issues will
be sent to all members of this list. In addition, free public support
is provided on this list. Please note that we don’t guarantee that
you’ll get replies to all your questions there or that replies will be
within 24hours.

**The mailing list:** Please subscribe at the `information page of the
mailing list <http://lists.typo3.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/typo3
-project-seminars>`_ . It's free, and you can always unsubscribe
yourself if needed. To send a message to this mailing list, just send
it to: typo3-project-seminars@lists.typo3.org

**The newsgroup:** To access the newsgroup, you just need to configure
`your news-reade <http://typo3.org/community/mailing-lists/use-a-news-
reader/>`_ r with these settings:
