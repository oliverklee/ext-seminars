What does it do?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This extension allows you to create and manage a list of seminars,
workshops, lectures, theater performances and other events as an
overview or as detailed descriptions. In addition, it allows front-end
users to register for these events.

Particularly, you can manage speakers, seminar sites and organizers
and use them for the seminars. You can get an overview of how many
people have registered for which seminar.
