- Now Web > Seminars > Update Statistics also shows the seminar dates next to the seminar title.

0.4.1
- Improved the manual.
- Increased the maximum allowed price from 1000 to 9999.

- more fields can be edited using PhpMyAdmin
- fields for which negative values don't make sense now are unsigned
- Added back end and front end support for the field special price in the seminar record. Note that all templates have changes in the part thats that contain prices: price now has been renamed to price_regular, and price_special has been added. If you use your own templates, you need to modify them accordingly, or the output will be broken.

- Added the fields accreditation_number and credit_points. Both of them are hidden by default on the front end, the back and and in the e-mails.

- In the seminar records, made the organizer entry required as it is needed for automated e-mail when a user signs up for an event.
- Note that the field "has paid" in the attendance records will go away soon. Instead, if someone has paid will be deducted by whether a payment date has been entered. So make sure to set a payment date for all attendances that have been paid.
- The upper boundary for the minimum and maximum number of attendees per event has been increased from 100 to 999.

- All semantically required fields now actually are set as required in the back end so that it no longer is possible to leave a required field empty (eg. an organizer's e-mail address).
- Removed the back end UI for fields that are not supported in this version yet: special price (seminars) and picture (speakers)
- Fixed wrong upload path for templates and CSS files in flexforms. Thanks to Rolf Casanova for reporting that bug.
- Cleaned up and slimmed down the RTE in the back end.
- Integrated the salutationswitcher extension so that that extension doesn't need to be installed any more.

- Fixed: The notification e-mail to the organizer contains the statistics of before they are updated with the new registration.
- Invalid seminar IDs in the URL are now better handled in the detailed view and the registration form: with an error message and a HTTP status of 404 (so that search engines don't index the invalid URLs).
- Fixed the CSS so that content directly below the registration form starts at the very left.
- If no user is logged in, a link to the login form is now provided.
- If there are no events for the list view, now a message gets displayed instead of an empty list.
- The error messages in the online registration part of the detailed view and the registration form are now organized more intuitively: The user doesn't to log in any more to see if a seminar UID in the URL is valid or if a seminar has been canceled.
- In the list view, there is now a column with direct links to the registration page. This column only is displayed if a front end user currently is logged in.
