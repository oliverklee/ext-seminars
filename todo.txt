To-do list and milestone plan for tx_seminars
=============================================

For this extension, there are still many unimplemented feature ideas. Help is very welcome! Contact the author if you want to help in any way.

If you find any bugs in this extension, please report them in the Typo3 bugtracker under the project tx_seminars.

Development speed of this extension mainly depends on whether it is funded. So if you'd like this extension to get developed quickly (or you need a certain feature), please pay for the author's time.

Hint regarding the items marked with [from dev-meeting 05/12], they got discussed on the developers meeting that took place at the end of 2005. Details about these points can be read in the notices of this meeting wich can be found at http://www.rimann.li/fileadmin/mario/typo3/Dev_Meeting_0512_060101.pdf (sorry, German only. If you have questions please ask.)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
- add an additional live check whether there actual are vacancies during online registration (in case of data inconsistencies)
- stop users from deleting their account if still registered to an event [from dev-meeting 05/12]
- handle deleted (and "marked as deleted") user accounts and seminars graciously

- flag: enfore payment methods if the price is > 0
- add configuration for default values for most of the seminar record fields
- remove the "has paid" attribute and use "has paid date set" instead; warn if there are records without paid date
- attendance records: make it configurable to require a payment method if a payment date has been entered

- only send e-mails if the sender and recipient address look valid

- make it configurable whether to count all registrations or only the paid ones
- check that all DB accesses use either intval, quoteStr or fullQuoteStr
- investigate whether to use removeBadHTML (like in the extension ve_guestbook)
- tx_seminars_objectfromdb::commitToDb() should also be able to update records
- tx_seminars_objectfromdb::commitToDb() should check for existence of a record before deciding whether to update or insert it

- only allow [[:print:]] characters in e-mail headers (Subject, To, Cc, Reply-To, Return-path)
- investigate whether use julle_encmailheaders for encoding e-mail headers
- change all occurences of header(string string) to header (string string, bool replace, int http_response_code)
- add meta information and constraints (primary key, foreign key, not null, etc.) to SQL file
- move the mobile phone number into its own extension
- have real m:m relations instead of the crappy "1,2,5" format

- escape square brackets in URLs (that are part of links as well as in e-mails), see http://bugs.typo3.org/view.php?id=3808
