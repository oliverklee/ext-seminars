This TYPO3 extension allows you to create and manage a list of seminars,
workshops, lectures, theater performances and other events, allowing front-end
users to sign up. FE users also can create and edit events.

Most of the documentation is in ReST format
[in the Documentation/ folder](Documentation/) and is rendered
[as part of the TYPO3 documentation](https://docs.typo3.org/typo3cms/extensions/seminars/).
